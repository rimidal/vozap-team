## Intro
Our challenge is all about Semiconductor microscopy process, Image processing, and Machine Learning. 
We started with 111 given input images (increased to 1500+ with our synthetic dataset) and developed a tool that can do classification and segmentation tasks. The result of our processing toolchain is output for MeRit System.

## What it does
- Classification
- Segmentation

## How we built it
- Data: augment, synthetic
- Preprocessing
- Classification
- Semantic segmentation
- Scalable interaction with a user (or API)

## Challenges we ran into
- Photomasking challenge (#2): classification and segmentation

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
- Our unique dataset
- Cloud environment for NN training

## What we learned
- Data labeling is hard
- MS Azure is a useful tool

## What's next for VOZAP
- Improve an accuracy 
- Publish the dataset
